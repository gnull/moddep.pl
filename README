moddep.pl - build dependency graph of linux kernel modules.

USAGE:

  moddep.pl [OPTIONS] path/to/module1.ko /path/to/module2.ko ...

The directed graph is printed to STDOUT in the form suitable for `dot`.  If
multiple modules with the same name are given only the first is processed others
are ignored. E.g calling:

  moddep.pl a/x.ko b/x.ko

will process only `a/x.ko` ignoring `b/x.ko`.

OPTIONS:

  --modinfo, -m      modinfo location, defaults to `/sbin/modinfo`
  --verbose, -v      print additional info
  --help, h          show this help

EXAMPLES:

  Show graph of all modules in subdirectories of current directory:

    moddep.pl -v `find -name *.ko` | dot -Tx11

  She same but saving graph to graph.png:

    moddep.pl -v `find -name *.ko` | dot -Tpng -o graph.png
